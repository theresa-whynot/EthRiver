# EthRiver

EthRiver is a test ether faucet that users can collect ether from and donate ether to.

## MLH's Web3 Global Hack Week Hackathon

I created this project for [Major League Hacking's Web3 Global Hack Week Hackathon](https://ghw.mlh.io/events/web3)! The challenge was to hack with Web3 APIs. This project uses the below Web3 APIs:

1. **Infura API:** interacts with the faucet smart contract on the ethereum testnet so users can execute transactions with their ether wallets
2. **Etherscan API:** interacts with live ether price, gas, and smart contract so users can observe live blockchain metrics they may be interested in

The web application is still in progress but please check out the mockup & smart contract for now...stay tuned :)
